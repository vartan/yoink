            Welcome to <strong>yoink</strong>! This is intended to be a tool for static websites
            to allow for faster navigations. Links are pre-loaded, pre-rendered, and cached when
            the website detects intent to load a new page (ex. hovering a link).
        </p>
        <p>
            Check out this <a href="second.html">second page</a> to play around with navigation.

        <h2>How to use yoink</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wrap the dynamic part of your website in an element with the ID and className
                <code>yoink-content</code>.
            </li>
            <li>For each static page, make a <code>.partial.html</code> equivalent which contains only the contents of
                the
                <code>yoink-content</code> block. For example, if you have <code>foo.html</code> make a sibling
                <code>foo.partial.html</code>.
            </li>
            <li>Add <code>yoink.js</code> to your pages.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>How yoink works</h2>
        <p>
            Links are pre-fetched under the following conditions:
        <ul>
            <li>When the pointer moves over the link (for mouses and touchpads)</li>
            <li>When a touch starts (for touch screens)</li>
            <li>When it is focused (for screen readers and keyboard-navigators)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a link is prefetched, it is rendered in an offscreen element in order to preload any contained images,
            as well as to minimize layout costs for later. After it is painted, it is styled with
            <code>display: none</code> to minimize any performance
            impact while it is hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the link is clicked, the currently displayed content is swapped with the hidden offscreen content.
